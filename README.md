## Key Metrics from the Dashboard

    Total Patients: 531 patients recorded in the year.
    Average Patient Satisfaction (PSAT) Score: 5.1 out of 10.
    Average Wait Time: 36 minutes.
    
 ### Patients per Age Bracket:
 
        Highest: Age group 1–10 years (73 patients).
        Relatively consistent across other age groups (around 62–70 patients).
        
 ### Monthly Analysis:
 
        January had the highest number of patients (65) with a PSAT score of 6.4.
        Lowest PSAT score: June (4.1), even though the patient count was moderate (53).
        Wait times appear to influence satisfaction levels, particularly evident during months like June 
        and September with low satisfaction scores.
        
### Correlation Analysis:
        Shows patient wait times against the number of patients across different times of the day. Peaks in
        patient count seem to correlate with an increase in wait times.

## Key Insights

  ### Patient Volume Trends:
        The busiest month was January, while February had the lowest count (45).
        Age groups 1–10 years and 51–60 years had slightly higher patient counts, potentially highlighting a need
        for specialized focus in these demographics.

   ### Patient Satisfaction:
        There is variability in PSAT scores month-to-month.
        High patient volumes (e.g., January) do not always correlate with poor satisfaction scores, suggesting efficient
        handling during peak times.

   ### Wait Time Dynamics:
        Longer wait times seem to lower satisfaction scores, as seen in months like June and September.
        Efficient scheduling during high patient flow hours (e.g., morning and afternoon peaks) might reduce wait times.
